\# Admissions Documentation Playbook



\## Single Source of Truth

Use GitHub as the central source for code, planning, and progress evidence.



\## Recommended Stack

\- GitHub repository per project

\- Serious `README.md` (objective, data, method, results, limits)

\- GitHub Projects (issues, backlog, weekly status)

\- Weights \& Biases (experiment tracking: curves and run comparison)

\- GitHub Pages (public portfolio)

\- Zenodo + Releases (DOI, optional but strong for research profile)



\## Minimum Repository Structure

\- `README.md`

\- `requirements.txt` or `environment.yml`

\- `src/`

\- `configs/`

\- `data/` (allowed data/scripts only)

\- `reports/` (short PDF)

\- `results/` (metrics and plots)

\- `LICENSE`



\## Documentation Quality Rules

1\. Every repo must be reproducible from README.

2\. Every experiment must have config + metrics + interpretation.

3\. Every project must include limitations and failure cases.

4\. Every week must have a log entry with evidence links.

5\. Every release must have concise technical notes.
