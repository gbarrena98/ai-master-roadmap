\# PHASE 02 — Math Core

\*\*Dates:\*\* 2026-05-07 -> 2026-07-15 (10 weeks)



\## Goal

Build the mathematical core required for ML.



\## Weekly Load (recommended, 12.5h/week)

\- 7h mathematics

\- 3h programming

\- 2.5h problem solving and logs



\## Study Scope

\- Integration + multivariable basics (gradients, partial derivatives)

\- Probability fundamentals through random variables

\- Logic, induction, counting, proof rigor

\- Computational intuition for linear algebra

\- Selective vector spaces and linear maps



\## Exit Criteria

\- Understand gradients, matrices, conditional probability, Bayes

\- Explain correctness of results, not only final numbers
