\# PROJECT 03 - Scaling Laws Lab

\*\*Dates:\*\* 2027-02-25 -> 2027-05-19 (12 weeks)



\## Objective

Run controlled scaling experiments and fit power-law behavior.



\## Scope

\- Vary model size, dataset size, and compute budget

\- Fit log-log curves

\- Compare findings with established scaling-law literature



\## Weekly Outline

1\. Experimental design (run matrix)

2\. Execution and logging scripts

3–6. Run experiments

7\. Clean and consolidate results

8\. Curve fitting

9\. Stability and intervals

10\. Literature comparison

11\. Technical writing

12\. Final release



\## Done Definition

\- Consolidated CSV/JSON run outputs

\- Curve-fitting notebook

\- Research report (8–12 pages)
